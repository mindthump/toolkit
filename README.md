# mindthump's toolkit for kubernetes

This is a version of my toolkit Docker setup specifically for kubernetes.

It includes kubectl running on Rancher Desktop, although it may work on others. The .zshrc from my dotfiles repo sources .zshrc.extra if present, and that sets up the kubeconfig.

See my GitHub "toolkit" repo for more details.
